This project focuses on the public transport. In deals with payment and booking of public vehicles, it enables passengers to pay using the app the cost that would been displayed and 
in return receive a receipt. A user can register either as a SACCO Manager or a passenger. 
The payment is done via MPESA which is integrated in the appliacation... SACCOS and Owners of public vehicles are able to track their incomes and see how many passengers used a particular vehicle at a particular time.
Bookings can be made easily using the application. SACCOS can update their posts on their particula vehicle eg destination, origin, terminal, date of departure, time and the fare to be payed. This information will be dispalyed in the Passenger page and the passenger will be able to book or pay for the fare.. SACCOS can post and delete their posts... The amount payed goes to the SACCOS paybill number.. The destination and origin inserted by the sacco manager are put in a spinner for the passsenger to choose from
